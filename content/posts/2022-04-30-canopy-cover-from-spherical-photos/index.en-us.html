<h1>Estimating Canopy Cover with Spherical Photos</h1>
<p>This tutorial was developed with the support of Althouse &amp; Meade inc., and many of the ideas in the tutorial are based on ideas found here were synthesized by Kyle Nessen and collaborators.</p>
<p>Here we aim to evaluate the potential use of spherical photos for the estimation of canopy cover. The goal is to eventually apply this towards analyzing the habitat of monarchs in local eucalyptus groves. Traditionally this is done with a class of tools called densiometers. These tools can be biased, and other tools have been developed to overcome these biases like the <a href="https://www.grsgis.com/densitometer.html">GRS Densiometer</a>. Similarly, methods using LiDAR and Photogrammetry (<span class="citation">Andersen, McGaughey, and Reutebuch (<a href="#ref-andersen2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> ), however LiDAR and other remote sensing platforms are not always available or affordable.</p>
<p>It is for that reason that this tutorial will aim at finding a more universal solution. Spherical cameras are small, portable, and relatively inexpensive, many offering built in GPS units at much smaller costs than bulkier hemispherical cameras. Much of the framework for this process was developed by Andis Arietta who also released several open license tools for conversions online (<span class="citation">Arietta (<a href="#ref-arietta2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> ).</p>

<h2>Data Capture</h2>
<p>Data was captured by me (Sam Ericksen) using a GoPro 360 camera on a 6’ pole while walking through the Coastal Access Monarch Butterfly Preserve in Los Osos, California. The area, can be seen here:</p>

<p>capture occurred over the course of a few hours, and involved grid lining out the northern grove on foot. The path of capture can be seen below.</p>

<h2>Cutting Images in Half</h2>
<p>360 degree photos are in essence spherical photos, and they are captured as planar (rectangular) projections of a sphere. This means that to create a rectangular projection of a hemisphere, we must cut the spherical projection in half along its horizontal axis. Eventually all of these functions will be applied to thousands of photos, so everything will be created in functions, before it is applied to photos, so we don’t read thousands of photos into the ram all at once.</p>

<h3>Creating Gap Fraction Index</h3>
<div id="binarize-images" class="section level4">
<h4>Binarize Images</h4>
<p>The first step in creating a gap fraction index for a photo is to change the values to either sky or not-sky, this process is called binarization, making all pixels either 0 (not-sky) or 1 (sky). There are many methods for thresholding these value changes, but we will stick with the default method developed by Nobuyuki Otsu, which aims to minimize intra-class variance ( <span class="citation">Otsu (<a href="#ref-otsu1979" role="doc-biblioref">1979</a>)</span> ).</p>

<div id="gap-fraction" class="section level3">
<h3>Gap Fraction</h3>
<p>Next up we calculate the gap fraction. here the photo can be seperated into rings along any number of concentric circles coming from the center, as well as any number of segments with boundaries being rays from the center of the circle. The image can also be seperated into sections for North, South, East, and West - allowing for calculations of direction of sunlight angles under the canopy. Unfortunately, we did not collect the imagery with any specific direction orientation, so we cannot utilize this part of the function. Instead, we aim to use a large number of images to create a very granular inspection of light interception in the area.</p>
<p>We must also decide which lens to use for your given camera for projection purposes. The list of lenses is extensive, and most name brand hemispherical cameras are included:</p>

<h3>Leaf Area Index</h3>
<p>Here we use an indirect method for computing the leaf area index , which is a measure of the “one-sided green leaf area per unit ground surface area” ( <span class="citation"><span>“Leaf Area Index”</span> (<a href="#ref-leafare2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span> ).
